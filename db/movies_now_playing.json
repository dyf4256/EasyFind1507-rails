Dieudonné, trapped in the exploitative structures of modern agriculture, communicates primarily through a mysterious network: the Amitié. An artificial intelligence and virtual reality that anyone can join and whose possibilities seem unlimited. When a crazy police officer suspects a smuggling gang is behind the network and Siegfried is picked up by a mysterious taxi, events take over.

Lydia, who has always had the status of a mistress, is not satisfied with just being Aris' lover, she wants to marry him, wants to be made queen of Aris' heart. Before agreeing to Lydia's request, Aris asked for Kinan's opinion, something he did because he apparently still hoped to get Kinan and Lydia's love at the same time.

Lydia felt that her position had reversed, she felt like a woman who had been cheated on and betrayed, while in fact, Kinan really wanted Aris and Lydia to disappear from her life.",

Fast-forward to the present: Aleppo, in the midst of the Syrian civil war. Amira, a paediatric surgeon, performs a life-saving operation during the darkest days of the conflict. Through an unexpected twist of fate, she and her daughter become central characters in a dangerous tale that intricately interweaves the lives of five families spanning four continents and redefines all of their existences. Versions of this story continue to repeat themselves over the centuries. For this reason, Shakespeare aptly named this plight “The Strangers’ Case”.",

Fast-forward to the present: Aleppo, in the midst of the Syrian civil war. Amira, a paediatric surgeon, performs a life-saving operation during the darkest days of the conflict. Through an unexpected twist of fate, she and her daughter become central characters in a dangerous tale that intricately interweaves the lives of five families spanning four continents and redefines all of their existences. Versions of this story continue to repeat themselves over the centuries. For this reason, Shakespeare aptly named this plight “The Strangers’ Case”.",
